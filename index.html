    <h3>Here's my story:</h3>
	  <p><img class="me" src="me.jpg" alt="Thats_me"></p>
    <p>Hi! I am a second year Ph.D. student studying <a class="inline" href="http://cs.miami.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a class="inline" href="http://miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a>. My research lies in Computer Vision, more specifically in the domains of facial recognition and medical imaging. As part of an interdisciplinary research project <b><i>"Facial Profiling: Defendant Physical Characteristics, Machine Learning Analytics, and Criminal Justice Disparities in Miami-Dade County"</i></b>, I am currently investigating how an arrestee's skin tone and afrocentric features contributes to bias in facial recognition systems, supervised by <a class="inline" href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/visser/" target="_blank">Dr. Ubbo Visser</a>. In collaboration with <a class="inline" href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/nxp161@miami.edu#panelCareer" target="_blank">Dr. Nick Petersen</a>, <a class="inline" href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/momori@miami.edu#panelCareer" target="_blank">Dr. Marissa Omori</a> and <a class="inline" href="https://www.law.miami.edu/faculty/tamara-rice-lave" target="_blank">Dr. Tamara Lave</a>, we were recently awarded the <a class="inline" href="https://news.miami.edu/stories/2019/01/new-u-link-awards-support-innovative-ideas-for-tough-problems.html" target="_blank">U-Link Phase 1 grant</a>.</p>

    <p>I am also working as a research assistant for <a class="inline" href="http://starexec.ccs.miami.edu/" target="_blank">StarExec Miami</a>: a cross-platform logic solving service for the <a class="inline" href="http://tptp.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/QuickGuide/" target="_blank">TPTP Problem library</a>, under the supervision of <a class="inline" href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/" target="_blank">Dr. Geoff Sutcliffe</a> funded by the <a class="inline" href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1730419" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a>. This is a fork distribution of <a class="inline" href="https://www.starexec.org/" target="_blank">StarExec</a> developed in a joint collaboration with the University of Iowa and University of Miami.</p>

    <p>In May 2017, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana State University</a>. My final research project focused on Decision Tree Learning. I developed the ID3 algorithm from scratch using Python and explored how concepts such as Gain Ratio and Random Forests can be used to improve the running time. I was advised by <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/~legri/" target="_blank">Dr. L&aacute;szl&oacute; Egri</a>.</p>

    <p>In 2013, I received my Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in Theoreical Physics Honours from <a class="inline" href="http://lancaster.ac.uk" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a>. My research was focused on understanding the mathematical formalism of Quantum Field Theory and investigating its application in the context of cosmology. My research advisor was <a class="inline" href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/anupam-mazumdar" target="_blank">Dr. Anupam Mazumdar</a>.</p>
