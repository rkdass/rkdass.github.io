    <h3>Here's my story:</h3>
	<p><img class="me" src="me.jpg" alt="Thats_me"></p>
  <p>
Hi! I am a second year Ph.D. student studying <a class="inline" href="http://cs.miami.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a class="inline" href="http://miami.edu" target="_blank">University of Miami</a>. My research lies in Computer Vision.

Under the supervision of <a class="inline" href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/visser/" target="_blank">Dr. Ubbo Visser</a> within the <a class="inline" href="http://robocanes.cs.miami.edu/">RoboCanes</a> research group, I'm working towards understanding how RL can be used within a simulated environment inorder for a robot to accomplish certain tasks. From learning how to kick a ball as it approaches, to formulating coordinated strategies amongst team members to win a game of scoccer.

In May 2017, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana State University</a>. My final research project focused on Decision Tree Learning. I developed the ID3 algorithm from scratch using Python and explored how concepts such as Gain Ratio and Random Forests can be used to improve the running time. I was advised by <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/~legri/" target="_blank">Dr. L&aacute;szl&oacute; Egri</a>.
</p>
<p>In 2013, I received my Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in Theoreical Physics Honours from <a class="inline" href="http://lancaster.ac.uk" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a>. My research was focused on understanding the mathematical formalism of Quantum Field Theory and investigating its application in the context of cosmology. My research advisor was <a class="inline" href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/anupam-mazumdar" target="_blank">Dr. Anupam Mazumdar</a>.
