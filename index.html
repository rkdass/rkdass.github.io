    <h3>Here's my story:</h3>

    <p>I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. student and <a class="inline" href="https://news.miami.edu/stories/2019/07/ambassadors-for-interdisciplinary-research.html" target="_blank">U-LINK Predoctoral Fellow</a> studying at the University of Miami.
    I am interested in deep learning, computer vision, and robotics.
    More specifically, I am investigating how deep learning models reinforce racial inequalities using theories and methods combining Computer Science and Sociology under the supervision of <a class="inline" href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/visser/" target="_blank">Dr. Ubbo Visser</a> and <a class="inline" href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/nxp161@miami.edu#panelCareer" target="_blank">Dr. Nick Petersen</a>.
    My goal is to develop interdisciplinary approaches that would significantly reduce bias in the criminal justice system by more accurately classifying arrestees based on facial feature classifications such as race, ethnicity, skin tone and Afrocentric features.
    Recently concluded projects: (i) I was a graduate research assistant for an interdisciplinary U-LINK Phase 1 project <a class="inline" href="https://bit.ly/2yFyLCu" target="_blank">“Facial Profiling”</a> where I developed and assessed state-of-the-art machine learning models to classify arrestees’ mugshots from Miami-Dade County based on race and ethnicity.
    (ii) I was a graduate research assistant for an NSF funded project <a class="inline" href="http://starexec.ccs.miami.edu/" target="_blank">StarExec Miami</a>: a cross-platform logic solving service for the <a class="inline" href="http://www.tptp.org/" target="_blank">TPTP Problem library</a>, under the supervision of <a class="inline" href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/" target="_blank">Dr. Geoff Sutcliffe</a> <a class="inline" href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1730419" target="_blank">[NSF Award 1730419]</a>.
    StarExec Miami is a fork distribution of <a class="inline" href="https://www.starexec.org/" target="_blank">StarExec</a> developed in a joint collaboration with the University of Iowa and University of Miami.</p>

    <p>Prior to my time at UM, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana State University</a> in May 2017. My final research project focused on improving the running time of the ID3 Decision Tree Learning algorithm using Gain Ratio and Random Forests under the supervision of <a class="inline" href="http://cs.indstate.edu/~legri/" target="_blank">Dr. L&aacute;szl&oacute; Egri</a> <a class="inline" href="articles/DTL_report.pdf" target="_blank">[report]</a><a class="inline" href="articles/DTL_slides.pdf" target="_blank">[slides]</a>.
    In July 2013, I received my Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in Theoreical Physics Honours from <a class="inline" href="http://lancaster.ac.uk" target="_blank">Lancaster University</a>.
    My research focused on understanding the mathematical formalism of Quantum Field Theory and investigating its application in the context of cosmology <a class="inline" href="articles/MPhys_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">[MPhys thesis]</a><a class="inline" href="articles/MPhys_poster.pdf" target="_blank">[poster]</a>.
    Supervisor: <a class="inline" href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/anupam-mazumdar" target="_blank">Dr. Anupam Mazumdar</a></p>

      <h3>Highlights and News:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Apr 06, 2020:</strong></dt> <dd>I will be giving a talk about my on-going research and latest paper at the Department of Computer Science, Ph.D. Student Talks, University of Miami.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Feb 10, 2020:</strong></dt> <dd>I submitted my first paper titled <q>It’s Not Just Black and White: Classifying Defendant Mugshots Based on the Multidimensionality of Race and Ethnicity</q> co-authored by Dr. Nick Petersen, Dr. Ubbo Visser, and Dr. Marisa Omori for the 17th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Nov 14, 2019:</strong></dt> <dd>I discussed how SOTA deep learning based approaches grapple with race-ethnicity classification for faces, and ethical and privacy challenges faced when developing facial recognition technology (FRT) at an invited panel discussion with Miami-based community stakeholders including Microsoft Philanthropies, Miami Police Department, and the founder of Kairos.
        In addition, I moderated an FRT adoption case-study workshop with 100 Miami-Dade College honors students at Miami-Dade College, Eduardo J. Padron Campus. <a class="inline" href="articles/mdc_frt_event_report.pdf" target="_blank">[MDC Event Report]</a> <a class="inline" href="articles/mdc_role_play_workshop.pdf" target="_blank">[MDC Workshop Template]</a></dd>
