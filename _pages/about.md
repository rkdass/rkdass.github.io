Hello! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student from Kolkata, India, studying at the University of Miami. My research interests lies in the development of <span style="color:green">**trustworthy computer vision systems**</span>. More specifically, I am exploring deep learning models' sensitivity and bias based on input data augmentation including the multi-dimentionality of labels, geometrical and texture transformations of images.

Currently, as a [U-LINK Predoctoral Fellow](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2019/07/ambassadors-for-interdisciplinary-research.html){:target="\_blank"}, I am investigating how deep learning models reinforce but can also help reduce racial-ethnic inequalities within the U.S. criminal justice system by combining theories and methods from Computer Science and Sociology under the supervision of [Dr. Ubbo Visser](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/visser/){:target="\_blank"}, [Dr. Odelia Schwartz](https://www.odeliaschwartz.com/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Nick Petersen](https://people.miami.edu/profile/nxp161@miami.edu#panelCareer){:target="\_blank"}.

Prior to building deep learning models, my background was in Theoretical Physics. I achieved my Masters degree in Physics from Lancaster University where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Anupam Mazumdar](https://www.rug.nl/staff/anupam.mazumdar/){:target="\_blank"}. My thesis explored the phenomenon of particle production due to an oscillating inflaton field within a non-expanding background using Quantum Field Theory.

Link to my current [CV](assets/pdf/rkd_cv_15Sept20.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

Away from work, I enjoy making everyday memories with my [better-half](https://sdutta-41.github.io){:target="\_blank"} and binging my favorite shows.
