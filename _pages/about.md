Hello! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student from Kolkata, India, studying at the University of Miami. My research interests lies in the development of <span style="color:green">**trustworthy computer vision systems**</span>. More specifically, I am exploring deep learning models' sensitivity and bias based on input data augmentation including the multi-dimentionality of labels, geometrical and texture transformations of images.

Currently, as a [U-LINK Predoctoral Fellow](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2019/07/ambassadors-for-interdisciplinary-research.html){:target="\_blank"}, I am investigating how deep learning models reinforce but can also help reduce systemic inequalities within the U.S. criminal justice system by combining theories and methods from Computer Science and Sociology under the supervision of [Dr. Ubbo Visser](https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/visser/){:target="\_blank"}, [Dr. Odelia Schwartz](https://www.odeliaschwartz.com/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Nick Petersen](https://people.miami.edu/profile/nxp161@miami.edu#panelCareer){:target="\_blank"}.

Prior to developing deep learning models, my background was in Theoretical Physics. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Anupam Mazumdar](https://www.rug.nl/staff/anupam.mazumdar/){:target="\_blank"} and achieved my Masters degree from Lancaster University.

Away from work, I enjoy making everyday memories with my [better-half](https://sdutta-41.github.io){:target="\_blank"} and binging my favorite shows.
